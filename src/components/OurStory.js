        </h1>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch">
          The property was acquired in late 2019 and Verve Properties who recently transformed The Avenue Centre just up the road are at the helm to bring the Bobby’s building back to life. After the collapse of Debenhams their plans to revive the building and revive The Square in the centre of town were accelerated and plans were quickly in place to re-open the building with a multitude of offerings as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch">
          Verve Properties are an ethical property firm that regenerates old buildings with the intent to bring communities together and provide an offering for everyone. The company have an ethical and sustainable ethos and focus on working with and securing local, independent, and socially conscious brands and businesses, to ensure that the regeneration reflects the changes Covid has accelerated in social and shopping patterns.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch">
          Building work has been split into a number of phases to ensure the store can open as soon as possible, with phase one opening on 7th August, with more elements opening all the way through the year and into 2022. First to open will be Bobby’s Beauty Hall, Bobby’s Ice Cream Parlour, an art gallery, and Drool - the world’s first food and beverage outlet for dogs, based in the tunnel leading to the Lower Gardens.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch">
          The beauty hall will house local, sustainable, and conscious brands sitting alongside the big global brands we are all familiar with. As an independent beauty operation, Bobby’s Beauty Hall will offer products and brands not previously available at Debenhams, who previously occupied the site. There will also be a Sushi and plant-based Poke Bowl Bar, treatment rooms, female and male grooming. The watch repairing station ‘In Time’ will be retained which is the only watch repair shop nearby.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch">
          On the first floor the large windows overlooking the Square will be opened up, new balconies installed, and the floor will house a food and market hall which is due to open later this summer. This will include street food outlets including plant-based food, a deli, a bar and speciality retail market pods. Spa facilities are in the planning stages and will hopefully open in 2022.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch">
        The second floor will house an art gallery with more details to be revealed in the coming weeks. 
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch"> 
        Accessed from Terrace Road, old buildings at the rear will be reorganised to create a garden area and a micro-brewery/craft ale smokery bar. Following that, plans are in place to open a fourth floor bar/restaurant and roof terrace bar. – all with a key focus on the local community.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch"> 
        Back in 1915, Bobby & Co opened in The Square in Bournemouth and remained under that name for over 50 years, only being rebranded in 1972 as part of the Debenhams group that has now departed the building. The reactions to hearing about the closure of the Debenhams in The Square had caused concern as local people had worried that without the department store that has dominated shopping on The Square and been a focal point of socialisation for over a century, that people would be driven away. There are also concerns about losses of local jobs. 
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch"> 
        And with The Twentieth Century Society reporting in the Observer last month that “landmark UK department stores up and down the country are at risk as Covid changes city centres and that locally beloved buildings, from 1930s classics to brutalist edifices, are facing developers’ wrecking balls” [source] – it is little wonder that people in the area were concerned. Verve hopes that this commitment to restore Bobby’s to its former glory will be welcomed by residents and visitors alike. 

        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch">
        Ashley Nicholson Director of Verve Properties says, “Bobby’s has historically always been at the heart of the town centre and the community. When we started our research into the history, we kept unearthing how bedded into the community the building was. We also found much of the architectural detail had survived but was covered up - so we took inspiration from that and have sought to restore what we can to bring back the grandeur of this iconic building, whilst the same time introducing some modernity to make it fitting for today. The copper domes will be repaired, the flagpoles reinstated, the 1970’s canopy removed and replaced by the original design, the 1933 front entrance designs brought back, new ornate first floor balconies to match the others installed and so on, all of which aims to be front and centre of our plans for a rebirth and celebration of both the Bobby’s name and original architectural style”. 
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 is-size-6-touch"> 
        Verve’s decision to invest in the project came about due to a strong belief in the potential for UK high streets to reinvent themselves after the economic downturn of the past 10 years. Online shopping and the pandemic have each played a part in dismantling the structures upon which high street retail used to rely. Responding to that issue, Ashley goes on to say, “If shoppers are going to be tempted back into town centres, then retailers need to value three key elements in any new structure and design. The first is to consider what kind of shopping experience people will still want “in real life”- beauty, clothing and footwear are good examples of retail that people want to try out in person. The second element should focus on how to make the shopping experience a fun and enjoyable one. The third should be to remember that ultimately town centres are there to serve the local community. It will take time to deliver Bobby’s back to its former glory, the building has suffered a lack of investment over many years, but with the patience and support of the community this project can play a significant role in the re-imagining of the town centre in a post Covid world. Regeneration is vital, but gentrification that alienates a community is the opposite of what new retail projects should be aiming for. We are therefore very excited to be able to bring this ethos to our plans for Bobby’s bringing back the glamour and the style of the original Bobby’s from the early 20th Century”.
